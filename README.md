üöÄ Project Overview
This project uses **Teachable Machine** to develop a deep learning model capable of detecting various conditions from **Chest X-rays**. The model identifies:
- **Healthy Chest X-rays**
- **COVID-19 Infected X-rays**
- **Lung Opacity**
- **Pneumonia Infected X-rays**

The model is trained using a dataset from the **COVID-19 Radiography Database**, including X-ray images categorized by medical experts. 

üîß How It Works
Using Teachable Machine's easy-to-use interface, I was able to quickly train a neural network to distinguish between different lung conditions. Here's how I did it:

### Steps:
1. **Dataset Preparation**: The dataset includes labeled X-rays of patients with COVID-19, pneumonia, lung opacity, and healthy conditions.
2. **Model Training**: The model was trained with multiple iterations using **Teachable Machine's image classification tool**, leveraging its real-time feedback and training accuracy tools.
3. **Evaluation**: The model was evaluated on a separate test set, achieving **high accuracy** in detecting various conditions.
4. **Exporting**: After training, the model was exported for real-world deployment and testing.
   
ü©∫** Use Case**
This model has the potential to assist radiologists and healthcare professionals in the **early detection of COVID-19** and other chest infections, making diagnostic processes faster and more efficient.

üîç **Key Features**
- **Real-time detection**: Upload a Chest X-ray and instantly see whether the patient may be infected.
- **Easy to use**: Trained and built on Teachable Machine, allowing for seamless integration and usability.
- **High Accuracy**: Thoroughly trained and tested on diverse datasets to ensure reliability.

üìä **Dataset**
The dataset used in this model is publicly available from the **[COVID-19 Radiography Database](https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database)** on Kaggle. It contains thousands of labeled chest X-rays, categorized into four main conditions:
- COVID-19 Infected
- Pneumonia Infected
- Lung Opacity
- Healthy

üß† **Technologies**
- **Teachable Machine** for model training
- **Python** for data handling and deployment
- **Kaggle Dataset** for the X-ray images

üåü **Future Improvements**
- Increase dataset size for better generalization.
- Integrate into healthcare systems for real-time diagnostic assistance.
- Deploy as a mobile app for wider accessibility.
